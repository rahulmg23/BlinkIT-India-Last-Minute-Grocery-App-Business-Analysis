   <img width="1466" height="804" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-23 195753" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d0f995e-6014-4ab0-a80c-8c23490cb354" />

   ## **Blinkit Sales Dashboard**

The **Blinkit Sales Dashboard** serves as an integrated business intelligence solution, designed to transform raw data into actionable insights across sales, marketing, inventory, and customer engagement.  
This dashboard bridges the gap between operational performance and strategic decision-making — allowing leadership to **monitor growth**, **spot inefficiencies**, and **act in real time**.

---

### **1. Sales Performance Overview**

Over the past six months, Blinkit recorded:
- **61.15K units sold in 2025** compared to **61.92K units in 2024**, representing a **-1.24% dip in growth**.  
- Despite the slight contraction, the overall sales volume remains **consistent**, reflecting a stable but competitive market presence.  

This decline, though marginal, signals **saturation in mature customer segments** and highlights the need for **product innovation and marketing optimization**.  
The trend line shows sales peaking mid-week and dipping on weekends — possibly reflecting **urban consumption behavior** that can inform delivery scheduling and promotional timing.

**Business Interpretation:**
The stability in quantity sold is positive, but the lack of growth reveals an opportunity to expand into new categories or improve customer re-engagement strategies through targeted campaigns.

---

### **2. Marketing Insights and Campaign Efficiency**

Blinkit’s marketing funnel metrics reflect a strong **brand reach** but a clear **conversion optimization gap**:
- **Clicks:** 239.37K  
- **Conversions:** 74.38K  
- **Impressions:** 967.56K  
- **Revenue Generated:** ₹646.62K  

The high click and impression rates demonstrate **effective awareness campaigns**, yet the conversion ratio suggests a need to fine-tune ad targeting and follow-up strategies.  

By integrating data from CRM and ad analytics, this dashboard enables real-time monitoring of campaign ROI and helps identify **which channels yield the most qualified leads**.  
For example, if paid ads drive high impressions but low conversions, reallocating the budget toward referral or organic channels could **reduce customer acquisition costs (CAC)**.

**Business Interpretation:**
The company is spending wisely on reach but losing traction in the middle of the funnel. Data-driven retargeting, segmentation by purchase frequency, and personalized offers could drive higher ROI.

---

### **3. Customer Behavior and Retention Dynamics**

Customer segmentation analysis reveals:
- **Active Customers:** 5,976 out of 6,082  
- **Customer Sales Ratio:** 61.15K / 62K target  

This strong **active-to-total customer ratio** underscores Blinkit’s **high engagement rate**, yet the small margin of inactive users represents **missed recurring revenue**.  

By incorporating Power BI’s drill-down features, the dashboard enables:
- Identifying **top 10% high-value customers** contributing to majority sales.  
- Tracking **churn risk** by monitoring inactive purchase periods.  
- Analyzing **purchase frequency and basket value trends**.  

**Business Interpretation:**
Blinkit’s customer base is loyal but under-leveraged. Introducing loyalty programs, early access discounts, and tailored bundles could convert passive users into repeat buyers.

---

### **4. Inventory Management & Supply Chain Optimization**

The **Inventory section** of the dashboard reveals:
- **Available Stock:** 71.83%  
- **Damaged Stock:** 16.76%  

While the available stock ratio is within optimal levels, the damaged stock percentage is **slightly high**, signaling potential **logistical inefficiencies** or **quality control lapses**.  
Trend analysis across weekdays shows stock movements aligning with sales spikes — suggesting that Blinkit’s fulfillment process is well-aligned with demand but can still benefit from **predictive inventory planning**.

By visualizing these metrics, the dashboard supports:
- Real-time tracking of warehouse stock.  
- Early detection of loss or damage trends.  
- Smarter reorder decisions based on seasonality and demand cycles.

**Business Interpretation:**
Improved warehouse quality checks and AI-based demand forecasting can reduce waste and increase profit margins.

---

### **5. Growth and Trend Visualization**

The **Sales Overview by Day** compares multi-year performance (2023–2025) across the same time window:
- 2024 outperformed 2023 in daily average sales, but 2025 plateaued slightly.  
- The **growth line (red)** clearly shows fluctuations — indicating **inconsistent campaign timing or supply chain delays** during certain periods.  

This visual layer empowers decision-makers to **predict slow months**, **allocate budgets efficiently**, and **balance workforce deployment**.

**Business Interpretation:**
Year-over-year growth is positive but uneven — highlighting a need for synchronized marketing, sales, and supply chain alignment.

---

### **Strategic Recommendations**

| **Focus Area** | **Insight** | **Actionable Recommendation** |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Sales Growth** | Slight decline in 2025 (-1.24%) | Re-engage customers through targeted offers, category expansion, and loyalty benefits. |
| **Marketing ROI** | Strong impressions, weak conversions | Optimize ad spend; shift focus to referral and retention-based marketing. |
| **Customer Retention** | 98% active rate but limited repeat sales | Introduce reward programs and personalized communication for inactive users. |
| **Inventory Efficiency** | 16.7% damaged stock | Strengthen quality control and logistics handling processes. |
| **Demand Forecasting** | Seasonal variation in sales | Implement predictive analytics models to anticipate demand spikes. |

---
